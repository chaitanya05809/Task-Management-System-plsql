Student Of Amrutvahini College Of Engineering, T.E Electronics & Computer Engineering Department (under Zensar Python and SQL Training)


## Project Description
This project implements a simple task management system using Oracle SQL. The system includes the following components:

1)Users: Users can register and log in to the system.
2)Projects: Users can create, view, edit, and delete projects. Each project has attributes such as name, description, start date, due date, status, and an assigned user.
3)Tasks: Users can create, view, edit, and delete tasks associated with projects. Tasks have attributes such as name, description, priority, due date, status, assigned user, and creator.
4)User Roles: The system supports different user roles (e.g., Admin, User) with varying levels of access and permissions.

## Key Features:

Data Modeling: The project involves designing and creating relational database tables with appropriate data types, constraints, and relationships.
SQL Implementation: The project utilizes SQL statements for data manipulation, including INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT.
Data Integrity: Referential integrity is enforced to maintain data consistency between tables.

## Technologies Used
